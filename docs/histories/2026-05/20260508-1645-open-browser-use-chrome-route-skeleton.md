## [2026-05-08 16:45] | Task: scaffold Open Browser Use Chrome route

### 🤖 Execution Context

- **Agent ID**: `Codex`
- **Base Model**: `GPT-5`
- **Runtime**: `Codex CLI`

### 📥 User Query

> Implement an open Open Browser Use Chrome extension route with an MV3
> extension, a Go native host/CLI named `open-browser-use` / `obu`, and JS/TS
> plus Python SDKs. Keep rewriting readable code instead of copying the Codex
> extension snapshot.

### 🛠 Changes Overview

**Scope:** `apps/chrome-extension`, `cmd/open-browser-use`, `internal`,
`packages/open-browser-use-*`, `docs`

**Key Actions:**

- **Added execution plan**: Created an active plan for the Chrome route,
  milestone validation, and real Chrome smoke requirements.
- **Added Go host skeleton**: Implemented native-endian JSON frame helpers,
  a native messaging stdio to Unix socket relay, and basic CLI subcommands.
- **Added MV3 extension skeleton**: Implemented readable service worker
  handlers for tab/session/CDP/history operations and a small cursor content
  script.
- **Added SDKs**: Added JS/TS and Python clients for JSON-RPC over the local
  Unix socket.
- **Updated docs**: Extended architecture and security notes for the new
  Chrome route.

### 🧠 Design Intent (Why)

The repository now has a public Chrome extension reference snapshot. This
change starts the open implementation with explicit source boundaries and
tests, instead of relying on copied minified code or Codex-specific trusted
runtime injection.

## [2026-05-08 17:20] | Update: add CLI socket discovery and manifest install

### 🛠 Changes Overview

**Scope:** `cmd/open-browser-use`, `internal/host`, `docs`

**Key Actions:**

- Added an active socket registry at `/tmp/open-browser-use/active.json` so
  CLI commands can discover the current native host socket without a manual
  `--socket` argument.
- Added `install-manifest`, `open-tab`, and `navigate` CLI commands for the
  Chrome route.
- Added lifecycle test coverage for active socket registry writes and cleanup.
- Updated architecture, security, and execution plan docs for the new CLI
  behavior.

### 🧠 Design Intent (Why)

The Chrome route needs to be usable by local SDKs and scripts without copying
ephemeral socket paths by hand. The registry keeps discovery explicit and
local-user scoped while preserving direct `--socket` override support.
