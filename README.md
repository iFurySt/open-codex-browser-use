`open-browser-use` is a browser automation layer that stays neutral across
agent runtimes. It is also an open-source alternative to the Chrome Browser Use
capability recently shipped in Codex.app. For the story behind it, see the
[Browser Use Deep Dive](https://www.ifuryst.com/en/blog/2026/open-browser-use/).

Under the hood, it pairs a browser extension with the `open-browser-use` CLI.
You can integrate it through the JavaScript SDK, the Python SDK, or the CLI.

## Quick Start

```bash
brew tap iFurySt/open-browser-use
brew install open-browser-use
open-browser-use setup beta
```

### Install the CLI

```bash
# npm
npm i -g open-browser-use

# Homebrew
brew tap iFurySt/open-browser-use && brew install open-browser-use

# Upgrade
brew upgrade open-browser-use
```

### Set Up Chrome

Register the native host for the extension, then install the matching Chrome
extension.

```bash
# The Chrome Web Store listing is still under review, so skip this for now.
# open-browser-use setup

# Install from the zip/crx package instead. Drag the opened package into
# chrome://extensions/.
open-browser-use setup beta
```

You can also download the latest package directly from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/iFurySt/open-codex-browser-use/releases)
and install it manually.

### Use It

#### SDK

```bash
# JavaScript / TypeScript
npm install open-browser-use-sdk

# Python
pip install open-browser-use-sdk
```

The SDK package name is `open-browser-use-sdk` on both npm and PyPI. Python
code imports it as `open_browser_use`.

#### Skill

Install the skill directly:

```bash
# Install for Codex
npx skills add iFurySt/open-codex-browser-use -g -a codex --skill open-browser-use --copy -y
npx skills ls -g -a codex | rg 'open-browser-use'
codex exec --skip-git-repo-check "Use open-browser-use to check today’s Hacker News and summarize the most worth-reading posts."

# Install for Claude Code
npx skills add iFurySt/open-codex-browser-use -g -a claude-code --skill open-browser-use --copy -y
```

Update an existing global install, including the Codex install created above:

```bash
npx skills update open-browser-use -g -y

# `upgrade` is an alias for `update`
npx skills upgrade open-browser-use -g -y
```

You can also manually download and install the
[`open-browser-use` skill](./skills/open-browser-use), then start using it from
your agent.

Downloadable `.skill` and `.zip` packages are available in
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/iFurySt/open-codex-browser-use/releases).

#### MCP

Install the MCP server into all supported global agent configs:

```bash
npx add-mcp "obu mcp" --name open_browser_use --all -g -y
npx add-mcp list -g
```

You can also configure an agent runtime with local MCP stdio support manually:

```toml
[mcp_servers.open_browser_use]
command = "obu"
args = ["mcp"]
```

The server exposes browser tools for tab listing, opening, claiming,
navigation, CDP, action plans, and cleanup.
